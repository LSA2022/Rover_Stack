# Rover_Stack

##Description
This stack was built to control navigation of a rover in mars terrain based on natural features from the environment. The environment and rover were simulated. 
All the packages have an informational Readme and references for the developers of some software, such as, LeGO-LOAM.

## Future Work
The future work on this stack will be improve rocks detection model, coverage path planning path and surfaces shape, improve efficiency of image_processor and design the on build real rover platform, in which will run the stack.
